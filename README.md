Next Point
2)Reliability of dataset: Only had 35 participants, some sets had fewer (like 14 or 11)
Sampling bias might apply, it is unclear how participants are choosen. As participants willing to make their activity data public they might be heavier users of FitBit.
-The dataset does not provide information about gender of the users. Bellabeat is a tech-driven wellness company for women only.
-The data is from 2016, so it is outdated as fitness trackers matured a lot since then.
ROCCC analysis
Reliable: low — the data collected from users without demographic information

Originality: low — the data was collected from third-party Amazon Mechanical Turk

Comprehensive: high — the data contained personal health data which allowed me to answer business questions

Current: low — the respondents were generated during 03.12.2016–05.12.2016. (better to have at least a year I think??) 

Cited: high — the data source was well-documented.
