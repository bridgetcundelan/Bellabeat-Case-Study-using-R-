### Background:
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. They focus on 5 smart products: the Bellabeat app, Leaf, Time, Spring, and the Bellabeat membership. 

### Business Task:
Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. These insights will help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

### Business Objectives:
1) What are some trends in smart device usage?
2) How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3) How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy? 

### Tools:
R for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis, and Data Visualisation.

### The data set: 
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
It contains 11 csv files containing FitBit user data. 

### Prepare the Data:
This Kaggle data set contains personal tness tracker from thirty FitBit users. Each eligible Fitbit user consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, hea  rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explor users’ habits. <br>
<b>ROCCC Analysis:</b> <br>
- Reliability: Sampling bias may apply as it is unclear how users were chosen to participate. Additionally, those willing to make their data public are likely to be heavier FitBit users which may skew the data. <br>
- Original: low, the data was collected from a third party survey, Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- Comprehensiveness: 30 users consented to share their data, which is the minimum sample size you should use for analysis. Two data sets only had data for 11-14 users ("weight_log_info_merged.csv and minuteSleep_merged.csv) so I removed those 2 sets from my analysis. However, the data I used was pretty comprehensive to allow me to answer the business question <br>
- Current: Data is from 2016, so it may be outdated. Additionally, the data is only 3 months from 3.12.2016-5.12.2016. Data would be more reliable if it was collected over a longer period of time of at least a year. 
- Cited: Data source cited well. <br> 
2)Reliability of dataset: Only had 35 participants, some sets had fewer (like 14 or 11)
Sampling bias might apply, it is unclear how participants are choosen. As participants willing to make their activity data public they might be heavier users of FitBit.
-The dataset does not provide information about gender of the users. Bellabeat is a tech-driven wellness company for women only.
